# CharacterController
This project is a test program that uses PhysX articulation objects to controll the character motion with pre-captured motion data. This is also one core component of my former physics-based character research. Although the project has unfortunately been terminated in 2020, I still want to keep the code in case that I may need this in the future.

**The code need to be refactored!**

**This repository is public until 2022/4/1**
